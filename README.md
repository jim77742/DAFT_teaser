# DAFT_teaser

This is a highly simplified version of what's available when you get Data Analysis For (Cricket) Tragics, yes that's us - DAFT

This demo contains a small portion of the already developed code, and only the Test matches which Ricky Ponting played in. With this you'll be able to get a feel for the advanced data analysis that's possible.

The full DAFT database contains a vast amount of daily-updated cricket data from across the world, and nearly a thousand lines of code and comments to analyse that data. Both code and data are continually updated.

Please read DAFT.pdf for more information, and for info on subscribing to the full DAFT database, please email jim77742@gmail.com

To use this demo you will need "R", "RStudio", "Tidyverse", and unless you have "git" already installed you will need to also download "GitHub Desktop". Typically Mac and Linux machines will have git, but Windows won't. R, RStudio, Tidyverse, and GitHub Desktop are all free.

These are standard tools for data analysts worldwide.

Read this section of Hadley Wickham's book for instructions to download R, RStudio, and Tidyverse:

https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites

Then go to:

https://desktop.github.com/

to download GitHub Desktop.

If you are unfamiliar with the Tidyverse, Hadley Wickham’s book “R for Data Science” is available free here:

After installation of the above, to use this DAFT teaser, you need to "clone" this repository to your machine. On the GitHub web page click "Code" and then "Open with GitHub Desktop". A directory will be entered where this code will go. Make sure it is where you want it, and then click "Clone".

Next start up RStudio and click "File > Open Project...", navigate to the directory you chose above (of your recent clone of DAFT_teaser), and then select the DAFT_teaser.Rproj file, then click "Open".

You will now be running RStudio, and the file "code_demo.R" will have some sample code you can run to load in the dataframes of Ponting's Tests.
