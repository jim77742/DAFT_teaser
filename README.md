# DAFT_demo

This is a highly simplified version of what's available when you get Data Analysis For (Cricket) Tragics, yes that's us - DAFT

This demo contains a small portion of the already developed code, and only the Test matches which Ricky Ponting played in. With this you'll be able to get a feel for the advanced data analysis that's possible.

The full DAFT database contains a vast amount of daily-updated cricket data from across the world, and nearly a thousand lines of code and comments to analyse that data. Both code and data are continually updated.
